# OpenMonitor IOS
IOS Open Monitoring App, allows you to make use of your IOS device to monitor other devices or use external cameras, this is an open source project and I'm actively looking for a team to work on this, students feel free

The current plan and vision is to have this app make your IOS device into a full blown monitor wether you want to use it for games, or (as I intend to) a camera monitor by buying a cheap usb capture card

It currently works on ipad and im ironing out the interface so I can release a first version, but the plan is to use apple metal to implement asistance features such as focus peaking, false color and zebras,

This being said,  this is mostly an educational project and will be forever open source,

the released version of the app will be governed in a benevolent dictator kinda fashion,

feel free to work, resell, rebrand, or do whatever you want with this code,

If you want to donate or comission specific features, reach me out!
